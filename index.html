        <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
        <p>Sustainable living is a lifestyle that aims to reduce one's environmental impact, in ways
            that are sustainable both for the Earth and for the person. So while pledging to never run your
            faucet again may be sustainable for the planet, it probably wouldn't be sustainable for you
            personally (or for your friends who would be subject to your poor hygiene).</p>
        <p>There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use of resources,
            composting, relying on clean energy sources, reducing your consumption of single-use plastic,
            eating less animal products, shopping for clothing and other items sustainably, buying local,
            and more.</p>

    <div style="padding: 30px;">
        <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;" id="difference">SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS ZERO WASTE --- DIFFERENCE? WHAT'S
            THE</h2>
        <p>Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and many similar lifestyle patterns, but
            are a little bit different.
            Those trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental impact in a variety of ways,
            while the primary focus of
            those living zero-waste is typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce, namely single-use
            plastic.
        </p>
        <p>For example, someone whose primary goal is to live zero-waste and produce zero trash may be comfortable
            eating meat that was
            purchased without any plastic. But someone aiming to live a well-rounded, sustainable lifestyle may consider
            the bigger picture
            (aka the massive environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) and opt for a plant-based
            meal instead, even
            if it is packaged in plastic.

        <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;" id="start">How to start Sustainable living?</h2>
        <p>There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably and a sustainable lifestyle
            looks different for
            everyone. Areas where you can
            reduce your impact include:</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact foods on Earth. To lower your
                        diet's footprint, consider transitioning to a vegan diet, or at least eating more vegan meals.
                        Along with this, it's important to focus on wasting less food.</td>
                    <td>Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like vegetable peels, avocado pits, and
                        spoiled leftovers) to landfill, start composting. Composting is the process of returning
                        anything that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade into soil. Setting up a
                        compost bin is super easy if you have a backyard, but it's also possible if you live in an
                        apartment or in a city with no yard.</td>

                            are
                            available to you. For example, try walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation,
                            carpooling, or investing in an electric or hybrid car when you need a new one. Additionally,
                            many environmentalists have given up flying in airplanes (such as Greta Thunberg) due to the
                            high environmental footprint, so consider traveling by train instead of by air when
                            possible.

                            (and more realistic form) of shopping is shopping secondhand.
                            Before buying anything new, check out your local thrift store, websites and apps like
                            Poshmark,
                            Craigslist, or eBay, or your local Buy Nothing group on Facebook. When it comes to items
                            that
                            you can't buy secondhand, seek out companies that make products from natural or recycled
                            materials while following sustainable business practices.

        <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">IMPORTANCE</h2>
        <p>With climate change becoming a more serious problem every day, it's now more important than ever for people
            to do
            their part to reduce their
            environmental impact. Demanding lawmakers and corporations institute laws or policies to help with that is
            extremely important, but lowering
            your personal impact can make a huge difference as well.
        </p>

    <div class="border" style="padding: 30px;">
        <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;" id="impact">IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
        <p>The average American produces 4.4 pounds of trash per day, according to the EPA -that comes out to more than
            1,600 pounds per year. So by transitioning to a zero-waste lifestyle, you could literally save thousands of
            pounds of trash from going to landfills, where it would emit harmful greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>By eating a vegan or plant-based diet, every year, you can save: 401,500 gallons of water, 14,600 pounds of
            grain; 10,950 square feet of forest, 7,300 pounds of CO2, and 365 animal lives, according to the Vegan
            Calculator.</p>
        <p>While it may seem like small changes such as going zero-waste or vegan won't really make a difference,
            looking at those statistics make it clear that sustainability lifestyle changes can be powerful.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 style="padding: 30px;" id="what"><b>WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO?</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Grow Food</b></li>
        <p>Growing some of your own food. Start a vegetable or herb garden, and plant a fruit tree or even two. This
            will save tonnes of transport greenhouse gases because the food will be right outside your door.</p>
        <li><b>Preserve Food</b></li>
        <p>Did you know that preserving food by pickling, drying or bottling is better than freezing in a refrigerator.
        </p>
        <p>Why? Because it uses less energy than the refrigerator.</p>
        <li><b>Reduce Waste</b></li>
        <p>Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal sites. This
            adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Dangerous materials also leaking from rubbish dumps and
            pollute waterways and soil from rubbish dumps.</p>
        <li><b>Insulate houses</b></li>
        <p>Insulate houses to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. Trees planted around the
            house will shade it during hot weather.
        </p>
        <p>Some people are covering roofs with living plants to stop the house warming or cooling too quickly.</p>
        <li><b>Use Public Transport</b></li>
        <p>Use public transport whenever you can to reduce the amount of gases from petrol powered cars. Ride your bike!
